The host_microbe_mapper was developed for analyzing dual RNA-seq data, such as
Neisseria meningitidis - Homo sapiens or the clams Loripes orbiculatus - and endosymbiont.

The entire script with all commands assigned can be found in "host_pathogen_mapping" which 
includes the tools tophat and bowtie for the mapping of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes.

All the required input parameters can be specified in a seperate Graphical User Interface (GUI)
